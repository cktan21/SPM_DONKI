# README: Frontend Project (Nuxt 4 + Tailwind CSS + shadcn-vue)

This project uses Nuxt 4, Tailwind CSS v4, and shadcn-vue components. Follow these instructions to get started and handle common issues.

**Documentation for Nuxt:** https://nuxt.com/docs/4.x/getting-started/introduction

> **NOTE:** Search for shadcn-vue not shadcn. shadcn is for Next.js

**Components for Shadcn-vue:** https://www.shadcn-vue.com/docs/components/accordion.html

You can also look at their `Home` or `Themes` page for some prebuilt pages or templates:

- **Themes:** https://www.shadcn-vue.com
- **Blocks:** https://www.shadcn-vue.com/blocks.html

Some of the stuff such as the templates in `Themes` may not have the source code on shadcn-vue website. You can look for it at their github repo

**Shadcn-vue github:** https://github.com/unovue/shadcn-vue

**Tailwind CSS:** https://tailwindcss.com/docs

## Setup

Navigate to your frontend project folder:

```bash
cd frontend
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
# bun
bun install
npm install @iconify/vue
npm install lucide-vue-next
```

## shadcn-vue Components

All UI components live in `app/components/ui/` (*** For this specific project only, read below to find out more)

> **Important:** Commit this folder to Git so team members don't need to regenerate components.

If you need a component that is not inside [app/component/ui], you can add them by running the command below:

```bash
npx shadcn-vue@latest add <component-name>
```

Example:

```bash
npx shadcn-vue@latest add button
```

By default, after you run the code above, newly added components will appear under `[components/ui/<component-name>/]`. Note this is another component/ui folder that is created outside of the app directory. This is technically the default way.

However, due to some importing problems which is not so simple to fix, i've added another component/ui inside the app directory, so its alot easier to import. You find them at `[app/components/ui]`

So if you happen to add any component using `npx shadcn-vue@latest add <component-name>`, it will be in the `[component/ui]` folder outside the app directory. You should move the newly added component into the `[app/component/ui]`

## Required: Create lib/utils.ts inside app/

<!-- I've forced committed this util.ts, so its unlikely you will need to manually add this file anymore. But in any cases you need, follow the steps below -->

shadcn-vue components rely on a helper cn in lib/utils.ts. You **must create this folder and file under `app/`**:

**1. Create folder:**

```
frontend/app/lib/
```

**2. Create file utils.ts and copy & paste the code below:**

```typescript
export function cn(...classes: (string | boolean | undefined)[]) {
  return classes.filter(Boolean).join(' ')
}
```

**3. Components can now import it:**

```typescript
import { cn } from "@/lib/utils"
```

<!-- Side Note: -->

> In Nuxt 4, `@/` points to the `app/` folder by default.

## Running the Development Server

Start the development server at http://localhost:3000:

```bash
# bun
bun run dev
```

Routing is based on the folder structure under app/pages. Each .vue file automatically becomes a route.

**Examples:**

- `app/pages/index.vue` → http://localhost:3000/
- `app/pages/abc.vue` → http://localhost:3000/abc
- `app/pages/auth/login.vue` → http://localhost:3000/auth/login
- `app/pages/dashboard/settings.vue` → http://localhost:3000/dashboard/settings

**Notes:**

1. A file named index.vue inside a folder maps to the folder route.
   Example: `app/pages/auth/index.vue` → /auth

2. Dynamic routes can be created using square brackets in filenames.
   Example: `app/pages/user/[id].vue` → /user/:id

This means you can organize pages in nested folders, and the URL will follow the folder structure automatically.

## Production

Build for production:

```bash
# bun
bun run build
```

Preview production build locally:

```bash
# bun
bun run preview
```

Check Nuxt 4 deployment docs: https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/deployment

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: `npm install ... failed` / `BuildMessage {}`

CLI may fail to auto-install dependencies.

**Solution:**

```bash
# Bun
bun add tw-animate-css class-variance-authority lucide-vue-next clsx tailwind-merge reka-ui

# OR npm
npm install tw-animate-css class-variance-authority lucide-vue-next clsx tailwind-merge reka-ui
```

Re-run the add command if needed:

```bash
npx shadcn-vue@latest add button
```

### Issue: `component.json already exists`

- Happens if CLI partially generated components before.
- **Do not delete** `components/ui/` — it is needed.
- Only delete `.shadcn/` or `components.json` if restarting shadcn-vue setup from scratch.

If you face the `component.json already exists` problem, try running `bun run dev` now, it should work

### Issue: Team members cannot run the project

Make sure they:

1. Navigate to the frontend folder.
2. Install dependencies (`bun install`, `npm install`, etc.).
3. Keep `app/components/ui/` present.
4. Ensure `app/lib/utils.ts` exists for `cn` helper.

## Notes

- shadcn-vue uses a registry JSON (`app.json`) to generate components.
- Default theme/style is new-york-v4. No need to modify unless customizing.
- Always keep `app/components/ui/` and `tailwind.config.js` committed.
- `.shadcn/` is optional, can be ignored in Git.

## Optional: Adding All Components at Once

> *** You should not need to run this step at all, since everything is inside [app/components/ui] already.

However if you like to proceed and add all components at once, you can use the code below

No official `*` shortcut exists. To add multiple components:

```bash
npx shadcn-vue@latest add accordion alert alert-dialog avatar badge button calendar card checkbox dialog drawer dropdown-menu form hover-card input label menubar navigation-menu popover progress radio-group scroll-area select separator sheet skeleton slider switch table tabs textarea toast toggle tooltip
```

> **Note:** This populates all standard components under `[components/ui/]`, which is outside of the app directory. After populating, you should move all the individual components into `[app/components/ui]`

> All team members should maintain this structure.  
> `app/components/ui/` and `app/lib/utils.ts` **must exist** for shadcn-vue components to work.

With this setup, all team members can run the frontend

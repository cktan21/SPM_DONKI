## Recurring Task Functionality

The schedule service now supports automatic recurring task creation using APScheduler. When a task is marked as recurring with a frequency, the system will:

1. **Automatically create new schedule entries** when the `next_occurrence` time is reached
2. **Maintain the same time gap** between start and deadline as the original task
3. **Calculate the next occurrence** based on the frequency:
    - **Weekly**: Adds 1 week to the start time
    - **Monthly**: Adds 1 month to the start time
    - **Yearly**: Adds 1 year to the start time
    - **Immediate**: Creates the next entry 1 minute after the deadline

### How It Works

1. When you create a recurring task, the system schedules a background job
2. At the `next_occurrence` time, the system:

    - Creates a new schedule entry with the same task ID
    - Calculates new start/deadline times maintaining the original gap
    - Sets up the next occurrence based on frequency
    - Schedules the next recurring job

3. The process continues automatically until the task is deleted or marked as non-recurring

### Example Recurring Task Creation

```json
{
    "tid": "1e5233e4-be0f-4f94-9c59-c6a72debe0aa",
    "start": "2025-10-18T06:43:45Z",
    "deadline": "2025-10-25T06:43:45Z",
    "is_recurring": true,
    "next_occurrence": "2025-11-18T06:43:45Z",
    "frequency": "Monthly"
}
```

This will create a new entry every month starting from November 18th, 2025, with the same 7-day gap between start and deadline.
